	<p>
	Welcome to my webpage! My name is Alyson Douglas.
	I am a graduate student at the University of WisconsinMadison.
	I study the effects of aerosols on radiaton.
	I have a dual B.S. from the Unviersity of Wisconsin Madison in Atmospheric
	and Oceanic Sciences and Life Sciences Communications, as well as a certificate in Environmental Studies.

	As a researcher, the content of research papers may be complicated and
	difficult to explain simply; I hope to overcome this hurdle by following the
	advice of Albert Einstein, “if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it
	well enough.”
	</p>
	<p>
	I have experience initializing, executing, and evaluating raw satellite data,
	to continue discovering the effects of aerosols on cloud microphysics and their subsequent effects on radiation. The topic is important to the atmospheric community, and has been an interest of mine since junior year of undergrad.

	Thank you for visiting my page, if you have any questions or thoughts
	feel free to contact me.
