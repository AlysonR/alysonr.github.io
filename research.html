	I currently am working with Tristan L'Ecuyer as a undergraduate research assistant.  For my undergraduate senior thesis, I studied the effects of aerosols on shortwave radiation in the Angola Basin.  Since then, we have begun finding the effects of aerosols on the radiative balance in the Angola; we are comparing the changes to shortwave and longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the cloud's physical properties that govern these changes.

	For our research, we use data from the NASA A-Train satellite constellation, as well as modeled data from GEMs and SPRINTARS.  The radiative properties of clouds are collected by the CloudSat and MODIS devices on the satellites.  NASA provides pre-calculated data on the clouds as well, such as aerosol index and vertical motion.
